Super quick BeShare instructions:

1.  This only support Haiku GCC 4.x
2.  Select "Connect" from the file menu.
3.  Once you're connected, click the "Start Query" button to look at the 
     available files.  (You can type in a keyword or regular expression 
     to limit the ones you see, if you wish)
4.  If you see one you like, click on it, then click "Download Selected Files".
     With any luck, that file will soon appear in the "downloads" subdirectory.
5.  To make a file or directory on your local disk available to other BeShare 
     users, move or copy it into the "shared" subdirectory (or create a symbolic
     link to it) and leave your BeShare client logged in to the server.

NOTE:  If you are behind a firewall, make sure you have checked the
       "I'm Firewalled" menu item in the settings menu.  In this mode,
       other people who are not behind firewalls will be able to download
       from you, but other people who are also behind firewalls will
       not be able to see or download the files in your "shared" directory.
