BeShare v2.30
http://dev.osdrawer.net/projects/beshare
===================

BeShare is a BeOS-native file sharing program.  It operates similarly to 
other such programs (Napster, Hotline, etc) but with a few advantages:

- BeShare allows you to upload or download any type of file, not just mp3.
- When browsing files, you can see their attributes (similar to Be's 
  Tracker view)
- Your query is always "live", so if new files that match your query become 
  available, you will see them added to the results list right away (you 
  won't have to click "refresh" or anything first)
- BeShare includes a rudimentary chat mechanism for you social types.
- BeShare supports any number of simultaneous uploads and downloads in
  parallel, but will serialize simultaneous file requests to any given 
  host for efficiency.
- BeShare connects to any MUSCLE server (see 
  http://www.lcscanada.com/muscle for details)
- BeShare comes with source, and serves as an example of how to write 
  a MUSCLE client.  


How to use BeShare
==================

To run BeShare, just double click its icon.  When you see the GUI, make 
sure that the "Server" string gadget contains the name or IP address of 
the MUSCLE server you wish to connect to, and then choose "Connect" from 
the File menu.  Once you are connected, you can type a query string in 
to the "Query" string gadget, and click "Start Query".  Any files that 
match your query will be shown in the results panel in the middle of the
window.  Note that once files have appeared in your results list, 
different attributes associated with those files (e.g. "Bit Rate" or 
"Play Length" for mp3 files) may be available for viewing.  Check the 
"Attributes" menu to see if there are any attributes that you wish to 
look at.

If you see a file you want, click on it, then click the "Download File(s)"
button.  The file will be downloaded into the "downloads" directory next 
to the BeShare executable.  (You should see a download status box appear 
on the right side of the window).

If you wish to make files available for other people to download from 
your machine, simply put the files in a directory named "shared" next 
to the BeShare executable.  Any files in or under the shared directory 
will be available for other people to download.  Note that you won't 
see these files as results in your own queries, but other people will see 
them.  (Note: symlinks can be very helpful here!)

That's about it;  you can also set your username using the string gadget 
in the upper right, and chat by typing text into the string gadget at 
the bottom.  Note that user names are NOT guaranteed to be unique, but
every user does receive a guaranteed unique session ID.

IRC commands "/me" and "/msg" work as expected.  That is to say,
entering

/me claps and cheers

will show up on everybody's chat window as 

Action:  <YourUserName> claps and cheers

and entering

/msg Jeremy Psst... hey buddy!

Will make it so only user(s) named Jeremy see your message
"Psst... hey buddy!"  (Note that you can specify a session ID instead
of a user name here if you wish)  You can even do wildcarding on
the names if you want, e.g.

/msg J* Look!

Will send the message "Look!" to Jeremy, Joanna, Joellen, etc.
When receiving a private message, the text will show up
in light blue rather than the tradition black color.

For information about other available commands, type
/help into the chat line.

BMessage support
================

BeShare listens for certain BMessages arriving at the port
of its main BMessage object.  The primary reason for this
is so that you can control BeShare via hotkey from SpicyKeys.

Here are some examples of text strings that you can type in
to the "Application" column of the SpicyKeys GUI to bind
a key to a BeShare action:

*SendMessage application/x-vnd.Sugoi-Beshare 'scrn' name=filename.png
   - Tells BeShare to share a /screenshot (optionally with a specified filename)

*SendMessage application/x-vnd.Sugoi-Beshare 'halt'
   - Tells BeShare to pause all uploads

*SendMessage application/x-vnd.Sugoi-Beshare 'resu'
   - Tells BeShare to resume all uploads

*SendMessage application/x-vnd.Sugoi-Beshare 'name' name=MyName
   - Tells BeShare to change your user name to MyName

*SendMessage application/x-vnd.Sugoi-Beshare 'stat' status=MyStatus
   - Tells BeShare to change your user status to MyStatus

*SendMessage application/x-vnd.Sugoi-Beshare 'serv' server=beshare.tycomsystems.com
   - Tells BeShare to switch to the specified MUSCLE server.

*SendMessage application/x-vnd.Sugoi-Beshare 'quer' query=*.mpg
   - Tells BeShare to switch to the specified file query

*SendMessage application/x-vnd.Sugoi-Beshare 'quer' query=
   - Tells BeShare to switch to disable the file query

*SendMessage application/x-vnd.Sugoi-Beshare 'pane' pos=50%
   - Tells BeShare how to arrange its SplitPanes.  This command has 
     several arguments:
       pos = position of a pane's splitter, either in pixels or as a percentage
             of the pane's height or width.
       which = which splitter to set.  0 is the main pane, 1 is the files area
               splitter, and 2 is the chat are splitter
       dir = direction to align the splitter.  V is vertical, H is horizontal,
             or it can be left unspecified to retain the current alignment.
     Multiple panes can be set in a single command by specifying arguments
     multiple times.  Arguments that aren't specified will be given reasonable
     defaults.

      * The about box now shows the version of your MUSCLE client.
      * Source code comes with a script to automatically fetch MUSCLE sources.
      * Uses the Haiku layout system for a smoother interface!
      * Redid the About window to look nicer.

v2.29  * Merged in YNOP and yuktar uptime code
	  * Compiled with gcc4 only 
           o Updated the code to work the with the MUSCLE 4.63
           API changes.  Note that this version of BeShare
           requires MUSCLE 4.63. MUSCLE 5.xx are still broken

v2.28  * Merged in Pintaio's corrections to the Spanish  
         translation strings.
       * Merged in Monni's correction to the Finnish
         translation strings.
       o Updated the code to work the with the MUSCLE 3.20
         API changes.  Note that this version of BeShare
         requires MUSCLE 3.20 or higher to compile.

v2.27  - Included François Revo's patch that lets BeShare
         auto-detect the proper language to use from environment
         variables when launched for the first time under Zeta.
       * Trailing ampersands are now included in URL links.
       * Query strings generated by dragging shared files into
         the chat view were not being formed correctly.  Fixed.
       * Fixed a deadlocking problem that would cause BeShare
         to occasionally freeze up when Private Chat Windows
         were in use.  Thanks to Andrew for pointing out this bug!
       * BeShare now launches HTTP links via the MIME type of
         application/x-vnd.Be.URL.http instead of text/html.
       * Merged in Oliver Tappe's HashFunctor namespace patch
         so that BeShare compiles correctly with gcc-2.95.3

v2.26  - Added Japanese and Finnish translation strings to
         BeShare.  Thanks to Koichi Kimura, Garjala, and Monni
         for providing the translations.  :^)
       - Dropped-in filenames now use a more human-readable
         label to decorate the beshare: URL.
       * Incorporated translation fixes from Monni.
       * /screenshot now presents a usable URL when invoked
         with a filename including spaces.
       * SendNotifyQueuedMessage() now checks to make sure
         _mtt is non-NULL before dereferencing it, avoiding
         a potential crash.
       * Fixed a bug that would cause disconnected clients
         to remain in the user list in certain cases.

v2.25  - Added a Swedish translation of the documentation
         to the distribution.  Thanks Paul!
       - Added a /font command, that lets you specify the
         font you want to use in the chat pane.
       - Added a "Shortest Uploads First" option that 
         tells BeShare to give priority to people downloading
         less data.
       - Dragging multiple files from the results list to
         the chat now produces the proper URL text.
       * "Open File" and "Open Folder" were broken if 
         "Retain File Paths" was enabled.  Fixed.

v2.24  - Added Xuqing Kuang's Simplified Chinese language 
         translation.  Thanks kuye!
       - Added Atilla Ozturk's Turkish language translation.
         Thanks Atilla!
       * BeShare will now download from firewalled clients that
         don't advertise a valid port number (read: Unizone ;^))
       * BeShare now parses URL labels with brackets
         nested inside them properly.
       * Some more English strings have been translated into
         the various other languages.

v2.23  - The "Open File" and "Open Folder" entries in
         transfer pane's pop-up menu now show submenus
         listing all the files in the selected transfers,
         rather than applying only to the current item.
       - The /screenshot command now includes the user's
         username and the current time and date in the
         generated screenshot filename.
       - The BeShare window can now be made as thin
         as 308 pixels wide.  Some of the controls at the
         top of the display will auto-disappear to make room.
       * Fixed a problem where DoUpload() could blow
         the stack and crash if too many files were
         specified in a single download request.  
         Thanks to Zaranthos for reporting this problem.

v2.22  - Added a "Data Compression" submenu to the 
         Settings menu.  If you are connected to a
         MUSCLE server that is v2.40 or newer, you can
         use this enable data compression on Messages 
         going to/from the server.
       - BeShare now stores shared-file nodes on the
         muscle-server in ZLib-compressed format.  This
         means that less RAM is used on the server, but
         it also means that older BeShare clients won't
         be able to see the attributes of files posted
         by BeShare new clients (v2.22 or higher).
       - BeShare's BApplication object  now accepts an 
         'smsg' BMessage, containing a BMessage to
         forward to the MUSCLE server.
       - Added mmu_man's ui_colors() patch for Dano.
         (You'll need to recompile BeShare under Dano
         for the code to take effect though)
       - You can now start downloads by dragging files
         from the results view to the transfer view,
         if you prefer to do it that way.
       * BeShare no longer requires a "port" field in
         the name-node posted by other clients.

v2.21  - Banned users now see an error string telling
         them how long they are banned until (thanks to
         Monni and Garjala for the suggestion).
       - Added marcone's code-patch that allows you to
         drag file results out of the BeShare window and
         into Tracker to make them download to the folder
         you dragged them to.  Thanks Marco!
       - You can now remove entries from the four BMenuFields
         by holding down the control key and selecting the
         item you wish to remove.
       * Fixed crash that would occur if you resized the 
         transfers pane to be very small during a transfer.
       * Compiled against MUSCLE 2.31, which fixes the bug
         that caused rate-limited uploads to sometimes
         stall.  (thanks to Garjala for all his help in
         finding this bug!)

v2.20  - Moved some of the miscellaneous info that
         was collecting at the bottom of the /help
         into its own command, /info.
       - File-transfer completion stats are now visible
         (if known) even when the transfer is disconnected.
       - Added support for the "beshare://servername/query"
         URL format, so that you can point people to files
         located on other MUSCLE servers.
       - BeShare now handles file-requests that come in
         during a shares-rescan more gracefully, by blocking
         them until the shares-rescan is complete.
       * Fixed a bug that would cause aborted 
         transfers not to be saved if they were
         never reconnected before quitting.
       * Fixed a bug that would cause aborted 
         transfers to disappear on login if 
         "AutoClear Finished Downloads" was checked.
         
v2.19  - If a beshare_settings file is found in the
         same folder as the BeShare executable, that
         file is now used as the settings file instead
         of home/config/settings/beshare_settings.
       - /help now reports the total number of kB
         uploaded and downloaded this session.
       * Tightened up the user name matching a bit,
         when matching on names with spaces in them.
       * Labelled-URL-links are no longer recognized
         if they span across carriage returns (to 
         avoid unintentional links in the catsup)
       * Logged URLs now undergo [label substitution].
       * Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause the
         query-in-progress radar animation to 
         disappear prematurely.

v2.18  - File information uploading now happens at 
         'low priority', so that it no longer blocks 
         outgoing chat text and file queries for long 
         periods of time.
       - Middle-clicking on a split-pane separator
         bar now causes the two child widgets to swap
         positions.
       * Tweaked the name highlighting to not trigger
         if your name is the start of a longer word.

v2.17  - Relaxed the SplitPanes' sizing restrictions.
       - Added a 'pane' BMessage that can be used to set
         the configuration of BeShare's SplitPanes.  See
         documentation for details.
       - The ColumnListViews now use QuickSort instead
         of BubbleSort for sorting.  Thanks to Ramshankar
         (aka Somebody) for his help with this.
       - Dragging files into the BeShare window will now
         cause a beshare: link specifying those files to
         be added to your outgoing chat text line.
       - Entries in the recent-queries popup menu are now
         truncated to a maximum of 32 characters.
       * ToolTips now only show up after a short delay,
         instead of immediately on mouse-over.
       * Included Infinity's new Hungarian translations.
       * Fixed some errors in the French and Italian
         translation string tables.
       * The query popup menu was inverting the query
         list order every time it restored.  Fixed.

v2.16  - Transfer animations are now limited to a max of 10fps
         in order to limit the amount of CPU they eat up.
       - BeShare now accepts a 'scrn' BMessage that causes it
         to do a /screenshot (see docs for details)
       * Fixed the tool-tip-sends-you-to-another-workspace bug.
       * Fixed several bugs that occurred when a labelled URL
         was placed into a username, status, or client string.

v2.15  - Added a /screenshot command, which captures and shares
         a screenshot of your computer's desktop, in PNG format.
       - Added an "upload finished" sound and system message.
       - Hyperlinks can now be followed by a name tag that will
         replace them in the text view.  Example usage:
         Click http://www.lcscanada.com/muscle [right here!]
       - Rolling over a hyperlink now shows the hyperlink
         URL in a pop-up "tool tip" style window.
       * The "Show User ID" option was broken (always enabled,
         even when it wasn't checked).  Fixed.

v2.14  - File transfer items are now double buffered so
         that they won't flicker while animating.
       - Added a Romanian localization (Thanks, Cypress!)
       * Removed the zoink work around, as it was b0rked and
         messed up Unicode characters.
       * TextControls' low-color was being set incorrectly.  Fixed.
       * Rendering of text in the FileTransfer boxes is now cleaner.
       * Added some additional German translations strings.

v2.13  - Added VitViper's colors prefs panel.  Thanks VitViper!  :^)
       - Added a /color command to enable/disable custom colors.
       - Private Chat Windows can now create their own log files
         (enabled by a "Log" checkbox in the Private Chat Window)
       * Fixed the high-ASCII-last-char-causes-chat-text-run-on
         problem (sorry Zoink!)
       * Locally-queued Download transfers were being cancelled 
         if they didn't start within 5 minutes.  Fixed.
       * /aliases now work in the private chat windows.

v2.12  - The /onidle message no longer triggers as soon as the
         last transfer finishes, but rather at the next stalled-
         connection-check afterwards (i.e. up to a minute later).
         This avoids having it trigger after every transfer in
         a sequence.
       - The Hungarian translation strings have been updated.
       * The stalled connection reaper wasn't properly reaping
         connections that never transferred any bytes at all.  Fixed.
       * Fixed the pending-chat-text-gets-sent-when-you-change-name
         bug, and improved tab-focus handling a bit.
       * Changed the %lli and %llu sprintf() format strings for 
         64-bit integers back to %Li and %Lu, since mwcc doesn't 
         parse the new format (thanks to Brian Francis for reporting 
         this)

v2.11  - Added Zsolt Bihari's Hungarian translation strings to
         BeShare.  Thanks, Zsolt!
       - The default muscle server (and server-list-update 
         server) is now beshare.tycomsystems.com (since the 
         BeFAQs server is no longer being maintained)
       - share: is now a synonym for beshare: in the chat log.
       - BeShare's BApplication object now accepts BMessages 
         to control certain operational aspects (name, status,
         transfer pause, etc).  This allows apps such as 
         SpicyKeys to easily control BeShare.  See
         BeShareDocs.txt for details on the what messages 
         BeShare accepts.
       * Replaced ShareWindow::OpenTrackerFolder() with linn's
         kosher version.
       * BeShare would play the 'download finished' sound
         when an upload finished.  Fixed so that now the
         sound is only played when a download finishes.

v2.10  - You can now specify a per-transfer bandwidth limit,
         either by right-clicking on the transfer box, or via
         the new /setdownloadrate and /setuploadrate commands.
       * BeShare would create subfolders in the downloads folder
         if the uploading client told it to, even if "Retain
         File Paths" wasn't checked.  Fixed.
       * Resuming a download through a symlink now works as
         expected (thanks to Shard for finding this problem)
       * transfer speed estimation now uses 30 blocks instead
         of 10, so that the average doesn't wiggle so much.
       * BeShare's install ID is now saved in a separate file,
         rather than in the beshare_settings file.  This prevents
         confusion when settings files are shared, or when 
         multiple settings files are used.

v2.09  - File transfer rates are now calculated using a
         running average over the last 10 blocks received,
         rather than a total average over the entire transfer.
         This method reflects changes in transfer rate more
         accurately.
       * BeShare would sometimes mark uploads as "waiting on
         local machine" when they shouldn't have been.  Fixed.

v2.08  - BeShare now accepts URL drops from NetPositive, etc.
         (i.e. drag a link into BeShare and it puts the URL in the
         chat text entry box)
       * Compiled against MUSCLE 2.15, which (hopefully) fixes
         the "Unknown uploader" problem (at least, once everyone
         upgrades, it should), as well as makes things a little
         more efficient

v2.07  - BeShare now supports "partial hash compare mode" where
         only the last 64 kilobytes of a resumed file is examined.
         This means that md5 hashing times do not get longer when 
         resuming larger files.  Note that both BeShare clients 
         must be version 2.07 or higher, in order for this feature 
         to be used.
       - Added some more Swedish and Esperanto translation strings
         (thanks Goran!) and removed the [Ln] annotation brackets
         from the Russian, Serbian, and Bulgarian translations, 
         since they are no longer necessary.
       - BeShare now has Korean language localization.  Thanks
         to dogigi for providing the translation strings!
       - When downloading, BeShare now transmits your name/sessionID
         to the remote peer immediately, instead of waiting for the
         md5 hashing to complete.  This allows the uploader to see
         who you are immediately.  (Note:  for this to work, both
         clients must be running 2.07 or higher)
       - When calculating an md5 hash for an upload, the client
         now sends the downloader a "queued, please wait" signal
         for the duration of the md5 hashing time.
       * Removed the auto-ping-for-client-version-info hack,
         since it would sometimes cause spurious ping responses,
         and isn't necessary for new clients.

v2.06  - Integrated in Vitaliy Mikitchenko's (a.k.a. VitViper's) 
         client-column feature for the users list.  Thanks, Vitaliy!
       - BeShare now auto-reconnects to the server if the server
         disconnects it unexpectedly.  If the auto-reconnect fails,
         it will try again after increasing time intervals.
       - Added in some support for the "/me's" idiom.  However, note
         that older clients won't display this idiom correctly, only
         people with this version (or newer) of BeShare will see it as 
         "binky's brain hurts".  Older clients will see "/me's brain hurts".
       - BeShare's md5 hash code cache attribute now includes the
         file-modification-timestamp as well as the file size.  This
         additional check will make sure that files whose contents
         have changed are properly re-hashed if necessary (even if the
         file size has not changed).
       - The shared-file set is now updated appropriately whenever
         volumes are mounted and unmounted.  (thanks to Shard for 
         suggesting this feature)
       - The language menu's entries are now always displayed in their
         native language, rather than in the current language.
       - File transfer requests now send user name as well as session ID,
         so that the remote client can show a user name even for unknown
         session IDs.
       * The idle-connection-reaper is no longer allowed to kill sessions
         that are doing the "Examining files..." thing.  This should help
         resumes of very large files work more reliably.
       * non-BONEd BeShare now sends a maximum of 1000 bytes per call to 
         send().  (This may help with some net_server+router setups. 
         BeShare must be compiled against MUSCLE 2.11 or higher for this
         to work)
       * file-removed messages are now batched together, so unsharing
         large numbers of files at once is more bandwidth-efficient and
         uses less server CPU.

v2.05  - File-hashing threads now run at B_LOW_PRIORITY.
       - Added a /fontsize command so you can make your chat font bigger
         or smaller to suit your tastes.
       - Code updated to compile with MUSCLE 2.11.
       * The upload loading indicator in the users list was broken in 2.04
         (always showed '?').  Fixed.
       * Added in some missing translation strings.
       * Fixed a bug in the auto-restart-download code that would cause 
         resurrected downloads to appear to be from "Unknown", rather than
         the downloader.

v2.04  - Added the filechopper utility to the BeShare archive.  filechopper
         is handy if a crash has munged your download and now it won't resume...
         run filechopper on the file to remove garbage bytes from the end.
       - BeShare now caches full-file-checksums in an attribute, so that if
         another full-file checksum is required on the file later on, it will
         be much quicker.  (note that partial-file-checksums remain uncached)
       * Downloads from people behind firewalls wouldn't start properly.  Fixed.
       * Results table columns and sort order settings are now persistent.

v2.03  - Added /shell command to the chat-command repertoire.
         This command lets you execute a shell command from the chat window.
       - Added /onidle command to the chat-command repertoire.
         This command lets you tell BeShare a command it should execute
         when all uploads and downloads have stopped.
       - Rewrote the chat-text-when-to-scroll-to-bottom logic, and
         made the ChatWindow change appearance slightly when it is
         "scrolled back" so you know what it is doing.
       - Added a priv: URL type that when clicked on opens up a 
         private message window with its argument.  (e.g. priv:username)
       * Updated the BeShareAndMuscle article in the html subfolder
         to reflect recent changes to the MUSCLE API.
       * Updated BeShare to use the new MUSCLE 2.00 APIs.  BeShare
         now requires MUSCLE 2.00 or higher to compile against.
       * Improved BeShare's font-sensitivity (with shatty's help) 
       * BeShare now recognizes https:// URLs

v2.02  - BeShare now remembers downloads when you quit, and restores
         them when you re-launch BeShare.  (Note:  This works for 
         downloads from users of BeShare v2.02 only)
       - BeShare now auto-restarts interrupted downloads when the
         remote user logs back in (Note: see above note)
       * "Awaiting Callback..." boxes now abort themselves when they
         see the user they were waiting for a callback from disconnect
         from the server.
       * transfer boxes are now better about remembering the remote
         user's handle, even when the connection is broken.

v2.01  - There is now a Sound-prefs-panel sound setting for a sound
         that will be made by PrivateChatWindows when they receive
         text and don't have the GUI focus.
       * Added new Bulgarian translation strings.
         
v2.00  - You can now toggle off display and logging of User IDs via 
         the Settings->Display and Settings->Log submenus.  (thanks to
         Technix for submitting this patch)
       - Changed source code to comply with the changes introduced into
         v1.90 of MUSCLE.  BeShare now requires v1.90+ of MUSCLE to compile.
       - Added an "AutoUpdate Server List" menu item to the Settings menu.
         When this item is checked (which it is by default), BeShare will
         automatically check with beshare.com on startup for new servers.
       * Building the file list during a download request is now done
         in a separate thread, so that large file lists don't lock the GUI.
       * BeShare was putting NUL bytes ('\0') into its chat log output.
         These would cause some programs (e.g. vi) to get confused if you copied
         and pasted text from BeShare.  Fixed.  (thanks to marcone for spotting this)
       * Fixed a bug that caused batch uploads to only transmit the
         retained-file-path of the first file in the upload batch.
         (more thanks to Technix for reporting this ;^))

v1.99  - The keyboard shortcut to disconnect is now alt-shift-B.
       - Added norseland.dnsalias.net and beshare.TyComSystems.com
         to the default server list, and removed beshare.bentonrea.com :^(
         BeShare.BeFAQs.com is now the default server. (thanks BeGirl!)
       - Pressing alt-L in a PrivateChatWindow now clears the chat log there.
       - BeShare now checks once a minute to see if any settings have
         been changed, and saves the settings file if they have.
         This helps keep settings from being lost if there is a crash.
       * BeShare now only prepends "BeShare v" to the version string
         in the /ping response if the version string begins with a number.
       * Some previously missing translation strings are now present.

v1.98  - Special "Save BeOS" version, available only on the BeFAQs CD!
       * Fixed a bug that caused symlinks not to get shared properly.

v1.97  - Multi-line pasting into the chat text line now retains
         the line spacing information properly.
       * File upload-resume was broken in v1.96.  Fixed.
       * /title now affects the window the command was
         entered in to, instead of always the main window.

v1.96  - Added Bulgarian language support (thanks to Zlatko
         Zlayinov for the translation!)
       - Added a "Path" attribute so you can see what subdirectory
         of the "shared" folder a shared file is being shared from.
       - Added a "Retain File Paths" item to the Settings menu.
         When checked, downloads will be made into a subfolder of
         the 'downloads' folder that matches the path of the remote
         machine's 'shared' folder.
       - Incorporated Hugh's (aka Gregor Rosenauer's) patches to allow 
         keyboard-based scrolling of the chat text view (by holding 
         down the control key and pressing arrow keys, page up, 
         page down, home, end, etc).  Thanks, Gregor!
       - Hugh's other UI change is also here--after you've scrolled back
         in the chat view, entering chat text won't scroll you back down
         to the bottom until you press enter.  People seem to prefer that, 
         so that's how it is now.  :^)
       - Added /alias and /unalias commands, handy for making chat shortcuts.
       - Added a /title command so you can force a custom title into
         the yellow tab of the BeShare window if you want to.
       - Added a "Remove Selected" entry to the transfer-item pop-up.
       - Added a "Move to Top" and "Move to Bottom" entries to the 
         transfer-item pop-up.
       - Added beshare.homeip.net (ZurGs' server) to the default server list
       * Incorporated Hugh's fixes to the German translation strings.
       * Added a missing comma into the _portugueseStrings
       * User ID is now shown in the title bar even if you
         are viewing query results.
       * Open file descriptors are now closed when the TCP connection
         is severed, rather than waiting until the GUI's transfer
         box is disposed of.

v1.95  - Added a "Load" column to the users list, that shows the
         current number of uploads from that user, and the user's
         maximum-simultaneous-uploads setting.  (good for knowing
         how long your wait to download might be)
       - Added a separate "Status" string entry box and 
         user-list-column (so you don't have to cram your 
         status into your user name anymore)
       - Renamed the previous /status command (the one that
         checks the MUSCLE server's status) to /serverinfo.
       - Added a new /status command that can be used to set
         your status from the command line, e.g. "/status eating"
       - Added profuzion.org to the default server list.
       - If both clients in a transfer are v1.95 or higher, the
         file data will be XOR'd as it goes across.  (this is in 
         order to circumvent certain fascist routers that filter 
         based on packet content!)
       - Added an "Open Logs Folder" menu item to the File menu.
       - BeShare's title bar now displays your session ID while
         you are logged in.
       * Fixed a bug that would cause text to be repeated in the
         log file when your name was mentioned.
       * Outgoing /msg's were being filtered based on the
         "Chat" menu item's state, rather than "Private Messages".  Fixed.
       * Fixed a parsing bug that would sometimes mess up the URL 
         highlighting in multiline text output (e.g. Xavier's
         catsup output)
       * Fixed the refresh problem that occurred when resizing
         right-justified columns in the user-list view.
       * Changed the factory-default username to "binky".
       * Changed BeShare to use the new include paths used
         by MUSCLE v1.80+ (so you'll need MUSCLE v.180+ to
         recompile it)
       * Blue focus rectangles are now drawn completely for
         all ColumnListViews.
       * Underbars ('_') are now parsed as letters for 
         username-highlighting purposes.

v1.94  - Added "Server Uptime" to the results of /status
       - /ping now returns the client's uptime, as well as
         the time elapsed since the client logged in to the server.
       - Added a "File Sharing Enabled" checkbox item to the 
         Settings menu so you can disable your file sharing without 
         having to move files around.
       - Added a "Ban User" item to the pop-up menu for uploads,
         so that if someone is uploading from you and you don't
         want them to, you can ban them from uploading from you
         (temporarily or permanently).
       - Added a /unban command that removes all upload bans.
       - Added a /autopriv command so that you can specify users
         that can remotely/automatically open a private chat window 
         when they /msg you.
       * Fixed bug that prevented the launch of items that were
         queued for upload but not transferring yet.
 
v1.93  - Selecting "Restart Transfer" on a download that is in
         the "Queued (Local machine too busy)" state now forces
         the download to begin immediately.
       - Added Technix's /watch feature so you can specify a user 
         or users to highlight in red (and optionally play a sound)
         when they say something publically.
       - /away now accepts an optional argument to indicate why
         you are away.  (e.g. "/away gone to Fiji")
       - Added /onlogin and /clearonlogin commands so that you
         can program BeShare to automatically execute a series
         of statements when you log in to the server.
       - Added beshare.dyndns.org to the default server list.
       - Added a BeShare-PrivateWndw sound so that you can have
         a sound play whenever incoming text appears in a 
         private chat window.
       - Added a /status command so you can see some information
         about the current state of the MUSCLE server you are
         logged in to.

v1.92  - Added an "Open Folder" option to the pop up menu
         to let you open the folder that the item being
         transfered is in.  (Thanks to Technix for this feature)
       - BeShare can now be launched by double-clicking its
         settings file.  If launched this way, any changes made
         to the settings will be saved into the same file on
         exit.  (Useful for maintaining several independant
         settings files if desired)
       - "Reset Layout" now resets drag bar positions as well
         as drag bar orientation
       - Added bebox.jocose.org to the default server list.
       - BeShare now pings the server after five minutes of
         inactivity (this way it can detect a broken TCP
         connection more quickly)
       * Hopefully fixed the 'gray gunk in the text controls'
         display bug that some people were seeing.
       * The LRU query and username menu fields weren't LRUing
         properly.  Fixed.

v1.91  - Added an auto-away feature (including an Auto Away
         submenu in the Settings menu).  This feature will
         add an "(away)" tag to your username after so many
         minutes of inactivity.  Thanks to Alan for this feature!
       - Added a /awaymsg command to you to change the away tag.
       - Added a /away command that puts you immediately into
         the away-state.
       - The initial shared-files scan is now done in a 
         separate thread, so that the BeShare window will 
         stay responsive during the scan.
       * Incorporated Phantom's translation fixes into the
         Spanish BeShare strings.
       * BeShare now recognizes high-ASCII letters (i.e. all
         those accented umlauty thingies) for name-highlighting
         purposes.
       * a.k.a is now spelled a.k.a.  (note period at the end)

v1.90  - BeShare now allows audio:// URLs which, when clicked,
         launch audio/x-scpls (e.g. SoundPlay) to let you listen to
         streaming audio.
       - You can now select 'Restart Transfer' on a queued upload
         session (i.e. one that says "Local machine too busy") to 
         force it to start immediately.
       - You can now select 'Halt Transfer' on an uploading session
         to temporarily stop the upload.  It will change to the
         "Local machine too busy" state until you restart it again.
       - URL tags are now case insensitive (e.g. "HTTP://" is highlighted)
       * ReflowingTextView::MouseDown() wasn't calling the base class
         method.  Fixed.
       * Removed the compatibility patch so that BeShare will transfer
         file attributes of all types now, and not just the 'common types'.
         This may cause trouble transferring to BeShare versions before v1.80,
         but you've all upgraded by now, haven't you?
       * BeShare now only uploads readily viewable attribute types to the server.

v1.85  - Strings that look like beshare:query will now be highlighted
         in the chat text window, and clicking on them will start
         the indicated query going.
       - /query is now accepted as a synonym for /start.
       - Removed the "Beep When Mentioned" menu item, and replaced it
         with entries in the BeOS "Sounds" prefs panel.  The new entries
         will be added the first time BeShare runs.  Set any
         or all of those to get your beep of choice.  Many thanks to 
         Alan for sending in the patch to implement this!  (Note:
         this is enabled for Intel machines only--the PowerPC I have here
         to compile on is R4.5 and doesn't support this.  You may
         be able to get this working by recompiling it under R5/PPC)
       - The About Box now contains buttons to take you to the
         BeShare web page, or the BeBits BeShare application page.
       - The number of file you are sharing is now shown in the title bar.
       * When opening the shared or download folder, Tracker is no longer 
         called using a hard-coded path name; find_directory() is used instead.

v1.84  - /ping responses now contain the version number of the
         client responding to the ping.  (If a version number isn't
         displayed, the client is v1.83 or earlier)
       - BeShare now sends a checksum along with each packet of file 
         data, and on receiving such a checksum, uses it to double-check
         the data's integrity.  If the checksum doesn't match the data, 
         it will abort the connection.  
       - The transfer windows now show the name of the next file 
         that will be transferred, even if the transfer hasn't
         started yet.
       - If you specify a hostname on the command line, BeShare
         will connect to that server automatically when it starts.
         (ex: "BeShare.x86 beshare.bentonrea.com")
       * The Home and End keys now behave properly when the chat
         BTextView has the focus.
       * Bumped the maximum size of the user-name drop menu to 20.
         (To accomodate my multitudinous identities)

v1.83  * Fixed a bug that would cause BeShare to crash if someone
         with a blank username tried to download a file from it.
       * Got rid of an unnecessary data copy that was occurring
         during uploading.
       * The ColumnListView class wasn't doing bounds checking in
         its SetSorting() methods, making it possible to crash
         BeShare while recalling an attribute preset whose columns
         were not present.  Fixed.
       * The download-restart logic was totally b0rked.  Rewritten
         to make sense.  (so auto-resumes now work correctly)
       * Users with blank names would sometimes get /msg's that weren't
         meant for them.  Changes so that users with blank names can only
         be /msg'd via their session ID.

v1.82  - Added Serbian language support.
       * Finally fixed the downloads-don't-always-resume problem.
         (Note that unless the users at both ends of the download
          are using v1.82 or higher, the problem may still occur)

v1.81  - BeShare now contains a special-case exception so that it
         no longer shares the /boot/home/config/settings directory.
         This is to prevent people from accidentally sharing their 
         password files, etc.
       - Added Norwegian language support.
       - Downloads that were able to get some data before being
         disconnected will now automatically restart themselves.
         This should allow people to leave downloads unattended
         even over flaky connections.
       - The User Name text control now has a recent-names pulldown
         menu, similar to the ones the query and server text controls
         already had.
       - Made the User Name field a little bit wider.
       * Entering /clear into a Private Chat Window now clears
         the Private Chat Window instead of the main chat window.
       * BeShare no longer asks "are you sure you want to quit?"
         if the B_QUIT_REQUESTED message came from outside the
         app (e.g. from a system shutdown or the 'quit' command
         line app)
       * It was possible to restart a completed download, causing
         BeShare to get confused and think it was an upload session.  
         Now the "Restart Download" item is disabled if the download
         had fully completed.

v1.80  - Added Oleg/2shed's Russian language translation.
       - Added Göran/BUser's Swedish and Esperanto language translations.
       - Added some previously missing strings for other languages.
       - BeShare now asks 'are you sure you want to quit?'
         if you try to close the BeShare window while 
         file transfers are going on.
       - Added a "Modification Time" attribute to the attributes menu.
       - Added some separator bars to the attributes menu.
       - File update counter postings are now limited to
         a maximum of one per second, to avoid flickering
         in everyone else's user list.
       - Added a /ping command (note that only BeShare 1.80+
         clients will reply to the ping requests)
       * "Malkovich" was misspelled as "Malkovitch".  Fixed.
       * BeShare is now compiled against MUSCLE 1.50, 
         fixing a minor incompatibility in the MUSCLE
         protocol that could cause BeShare to disconnect
         from the server in some circumstances.
       * BeShare now only transmits BFS attribute types that
         are parsable by old versions of BeShare.  This maintains
         compatibility with old BeShare clients in the short term,
         although this hack will be removed in future versions.
         (thanks to Benji Park for spotting this problem!)

v1.74  - Added BeShare.BeFAQs.com to the server list
       - Added a results page size selection submenu to the
         Settings menu.
       - Bots now have their names italicized in the user list.
       - Added French docs to the distribution.
       - Right clicking on the results view now brings up
         a pop up menu of pages to switch to, when appropriate.
       - Added a /ignore command that lets you specify a user
         or set of users whose chat messages you wish not to see.
       - The transfer list now presents a pop-up menu when right
         clicked.  This pop-up menu lets you move, halt, restart 
         or launch the selected transfer items.
       * Fixed a race condition that would sometimes cause interrupted
         downloads to be removed from the display when they shouldn't be. 
       * Fixed the unique-file-name generator.  Now it will go
         from "filename.txt" to "filename.txt 2" to "filename.txt 3",
         instead of "filename.txt" to "filename.txt 2" to
         "filename.txt 2 2".
       * Chat text view now scrolls to the bottom whenever you
         enter a character into the chat text entry gadget, even
         if the chat text entry gadget already had the focus.
       * Fixed a bug in the chat history that made it sometimes
         display the wrong text when you pressed up-arrow.
       * Text from private chat windows is now logged to the log file.
       * Added some printf's to the md5 hashing code, in the hopes
         of some day figuring out why file downloads don't always
         resume.

v1.73  - The chat text view now automatically scrolls to
         the bottom when you type into the chat text entry box.
       - Orange-name highlighting now only occurs if your name
         is at the start of a word in the text (this cuts down
         on unintentional matches)
       - New default servers are now automatically added to the
         server pull-down menu on startup.
       - Sorting selections are now saved and restored in the
         users list and in the attributes-presets.
       * trailing slashes are now treated as part of the click-URLs.
       * BeShare now closes the log file when you disable
         file logging, and opens a new one when you re-enable it.
       * Fixed a truly nasty bug that would cause BeShare to
         crash whenever duplicate filenames showed up in the
         results list.

v1.72  - The transfer box now shows the remote user's session
         ID in addition to their handle.
       - Empty query strings are no longer intepreted as '*'.
       - Pressing return in the file query box now enables
         the query implicitely.
       - Large result sets are now broken into 'pages' of
         1000 items each.  Arrow buttons are provided to
         switch from one page to another.  Note that each
         page is sorted internally, rather than sorting
         over the entire result set!
       - Common, well-formed URLs in the chat window are
         now highlighted in blue, and clickable (similar to
         how BeMail works).
       - Rewrote the chat filtering code, and added logging-to-file
         capability.  The "Log" submenu now controls logging to a
         file, while the new "Display" submenu controls what types
         of info are displayed in the Chat view.
       - Changed 12.18.240.15 to beshare.bentonrea.com
         in the default servers menu.
       - Intel Executable now requires BeOS R5.0.3.  (You can still
         run it under R4.5, but you'll have to recompile it yourself)
       - Now compiled with optimizations turned on.
       - Removed the logging of query changes, as it wasn't very useful.
       * The SplitPane draggers could be dragged from the edges
         of the window, which was kind of weird.  Fixed.
       * Text in private chat windows that started with "//"
         was being sent to everybody, not just the private-chat
         participants.  Fixed.
       * Fixed some other minor text parsing bugs
       * Now uses DispatchMessage() instead of BMessageFilters
         to redirect focus.  This will hopefully clear up the
         assertion failures some people were seeing.

v1.71  - Changed the shared-file lookup to use an in-memory
         lookup table, rather than iterating through the shared
         directory tree each time.  (suggested by Christopher Tate)
       - You can now right-click on the users list in the main
         window to open a Private Chat Window to one or more users.
       - Private chat windows now contain a list of users specified
         by the private chat filter string (so you know for sure 
         who you are talking at)
       - There is now a little radar animation that shows up whenever
         the server is busy retrieving the initial results of your
         query.  (So you can tell when all results are available)
       * Fixed a bug where BeShare would crash if you
         entered a blank line into the chat text entry.
         Thanks to Zathros (Ted Leeuwesteijn) for reporting this bug.
       * Chat BTextView rectangle wasn't being sized correctly on startup.
       * Tab completion now works correctly in the private chat windows.

v1.70  - Added "Private chat window" capability.
       - Added Save and Restore Presets submenus to the
         Attributes menu, so that you can save how you
         have the results table configured and later restore it. 
       - session IDs are now sorted numerically, rather than
         lexically, in the user table.
       - widths and sorting of columns in the user table is
         now persistent.
       - All string sorting is now done case insensitive.
       - Chat line now has the focus on startup.
       - File-searches are now done in a separate thread,
         so that they won't freeze up the GUI.
       - You can now toggle between firewalled and non-firewalled
         without having to disconnect from the server first.
       - double-clicking on a file in the results view now
         starts a download of that file.
       - /commands are now case insensitive
       - unknown /commands now result in an error message being
         printed locally, rather than the /command text being
         sent as a chat message.  (to send a chat message starting
         with '/', you'll need to start your message with '//')
       - Leading and trailing spaces are now automatically trimmed
         off of your user name when you enter it.
       * You can now send a /msg by username to people
         whose usernames contain spaces.
       * Chat window now scrolls down correctly even when
         you enter large amounts of text.
       * Tab completion no longer adds a space after the
         end of a tab completed name.
       * BeShare's tab completion no longer disables the 
         Twitcher when the chat text entry control has the focus.
       * Queries for e.g. *.mp3@123 were being altered into
         e.g. *.mp3@*123*.  This would cause the server to 
         return unwanted results if the session ID you were 
         interested in was a substring of other session IDs.
         Fixed.

v1.63  - Added "Max Simultaneous Downloads Per User" menu.
       - Added tab-completion for user names in the chat
         window.  Thanks to BGA for his help in coding this!
       - Added Italian localization (thanks to Dario Accornero
         for translating!)
       - alt-Enter now works the same as Enter, to quiet those
         hardcore ICQ junkies.
       - Added a "Login on Startup" option.
       - Added a separate log toggle for choosing whether or
         not to see private messages (vs. public chat messages)
       * Fixed a bug that would send garbage data if you
         /msg'd somebody without any message
       * Incorporated German and Dutch translation fixes from
         hoshy and Zathros.
       * Now compiles cleanly even in paranoid -Wall mode.
         Thanks to Christopher Tate for cleaning up the code!!
       * Changed the subscription to just use beshare/* so that
         it works better with FreeBSD servers.
       * The "Open Download Folder" and "Open Shared Folder" 
         menu items didn't work if there were spaces in BeShare's
         path.  Now, they do.

v1.62  - Added optional Timestamp logging to the chat view.
       - Added an "AutoClear Completed Downloads" menu option.
       * Downloading from firewalled users was broken in v1.61.  Fixed.
       * Fixed a bug that was causing it to look as if users
         were logging back in immediately after they logged off.
       * Changed the your-name-mentioned highlighting from red 
         to orange, to make it visible to people who can't 
         differentiate red from black.
       * BeShare would sometimes beep when it wasn't supposed to.  Stopped.
       * The your-name-mentioned coloring wasn't being positioned
         right in /action messages.  Fixed.

v1.61  - You now have the option of enabling/disabling logging
         of chat comments in the chat window.
       - The firewall port range is now 7000-7050.
       - The Query label is now a drop-down menu that allows you
         to quickly recover your 20 most recently used queries.
       - The "couldn't start thread" error message now suggests
         that you restart networking.
       - The MD5 hash file read buffer is now 256k instead of 1k.
         This should speed up the initialization of file resume downloads.
       - Added more language support:  BeShare now speaks French and Malkovitch.
       - Added a "reaper" that will forcibly abort connections that
         are active, but haven't transferred any data for more than
         five minutes.  This keeps moribund connections from permanently
         tying up open download slots.
       - /msg Now takes wildcards in the target user name.
       - Added a "Beep When Mentioned" feature, so you can be notified
         when people are talking to or about you.
       - If someone mentions your name, it will be shown in red in the chat log.
       - Added a "Max Simultaneous Uploads Per User" feature to cut down on
         slot-hogging.
       - File counts that you can't access due to firewalling issues
         now have (parentheses around them).
       * The settings file is now found with find_directory()
         rather than with a hard-coded path string.
       * The GUI now holds Portuguese text strings without clipping them.
       * "Full User Queries" option now works reliably.
       * Callback accepting is now done on the "standard" ports starting
         at 7000, so that it will work over properly portmapped firewalls.
       * Portuguese text now fits in the GUI better.
       * Fixed the "query gets reposted when you click Start, then
         change focus" bug.

v1.60  - Added some localization support.  BeShare now speaks
         English, Spanish, Dutch, German, and Portuguese!  
         If you want another language added to BeShare, please email me.
         (Thanks to Phantom, Zathros, BGA, and hoshy for translating)
       - BeShare now reports the total byte count of the
         displayed result set, in the title bar.
       - Added some more irc-style commands, including /clear,
         /start, /stop, /disconnect, /quit, and /help. Enter
         /help for instructions on how to use them.
       - Added "# Files shared" and "Connection speed" columns 
         to the users table.  (Note:  "# Files shared" will only
         be set correctly if the user has BeShare 1.60 or above)
       - When you change your name in the "Username" text box,
         focus now automatically jumps to the chat text entry.
       - Double clicking a file transfer box now launches
         the file mentioned in the box, as if you had double-clicked it.
       - Added a "history" function:  using the arrow keys while the
         chat text entry box has the focus allows you to review the
         last 500 lines you typed in.
       - Transfer boxes now have a little scrolly barber shop stripe
         animation in them that gives you an idea of how quickly you 
         are sending or receiving file data messages.  (Mmm, Juicyfruit!)
       - MD5 calculations are now done in separate background threads.
         This should keep BeShare's GUI from freezing up when resuming
         downloads or uploads of very large files.
       - Empty MIME attribute entries no longer show up in the
         Attributes menu.
       * Fixed a bug in the file-examining routine that was
         associating the wrong data-type with file attributes.
         (this was the bug that was causing Track numbers to show up
         as rectangle characters.  Note that the rectangles will still
         be seen if the person sharing the file hasn't upgraded!)

v1.52b - BeShare now tries to listen on ports 7000 through 7010
         before choosing an arbitrary port to listen on.  It also prints
         out the port it is listening on into the chat window.  (This
         makes it easier for people behind firewalls/NAT boxes to share
         files)
       - Server hostnames/IP addresses are now automatically added to a
         BMenuField so that you can select them from a list.  No more
         forgetting your server's address!
       - Added whitespace stripping to the chat text parsing
       - Results and users lists are now navigable via the arrow keys, 
         pageup/pagedown, home/end, etc.
       - Pressing return while the results list has the focus is now
         the same as clicking the "download selected files" button.
       - Pressing an alphanumeric key while any of the four main panels 
         has the focus automatically transfers the focus the chat text
         entry box.
       - Included PPC build in this release.

v1.51b - Added "Open Shared Folder" and "Open Downloads Folder" entries
         to the File menu.
       - Log Uploads has been moved into a "Log" submenu, and is joined
         by "Log User Events" and "Log Query Changes" toggles.
       - Hard-coded attributes in the "Attributes" menu now have
         keyboard shortcuts
       - Added "Full User Queries" toggle to the Settings menu.
         When set, this mysterious setting will make double-clicking
         a username set the current query to "*@sessionID", rather than
         "currentFileQuery@sessionID".
       - The BeShare title bar now tells you how many results you
         currently have displayed.
       * time remaining now shows hours:minutes:seconds if necessary,
         instead of just minutes:seconds
       * Fixed a bug that was causing duplicate MIME entries
         to show up in the Attributes menu.

v1.50b - BeShare now supports sharing of directories and
         symlinks to directories.  (Note that duplicate filenames
         aren't supported--if you share two or more files with the same
         name, only one will show up in the file listings, and
         it will be indeterminate which file people get when they
         select that listing for download)
       - You can now do query-by-session-ID, e.g. "*@172".
       - double-clicking a user's name will now set the current
         query to only look at that user's files.
       - Added bytes-per-second and ETA indicators to the transfer boxes.
       - IRC-style "/nick" command now supported.
       - "/action" is now supported as a synonym for "/me".
       - The username you specify with "/msg" is now case-insensitive.

v1.41b * Transferring files to and from people behind firewalls
         was broken.  It's fixed now.
       - PowerPC version is gone again, as I'm at home and
         don't have a PowerPC handy to compile it on... 

v1.40b - Added "max simultaneous downloads" menu.  Now
         you can select and queue up as many transfers as you
         want, and BeShare will delay starting them until
         there is "room" for them.
       - BeShare queries can now be of the form
         fileExp@userExp, where userExp is the name of  
         another user (or a regular expression matching
         against other user's names).  When a query is
         of this form, only files that match both expressions
         will be shown.  (Limitation: the user expression is
         evaluated statically, and thus isn't 'live')
         Simple Example: *.mp3@Jeremy
         Fancy Example:  *.(mp?,avi)@(Jeremy,Joanna,*away)
       - If you have scrolled back in the chat view, the
         view will no longer automatically scroll back down
         to the bottom of the chat listing when a new 
         message is received.
       - BeShare now filters out 'old' query results
         so that when you change queries, you won't
         end up with bits of the old result set in your
         new result set.
       - BeShare now sends a PR_COMMAND_JETTISON_RESULTS
         message when the query is halted or changed, so
         that you don't have to finish downloading the old
         result set before you getting the new one.
       - PowerPC version included again!
       * The initial shared-file-data upload is now partitioned
         into 50-filename segments, for better performance.
       * Increasing a threshold via the "Max Simultaneous..."
         menus will now immediately activate any queued
         transfers so that the new threshold is met.
       * Removed key-shortcut for 'About' (so now
         you can alt-a to select all in the chat window)
       * Changed 'Connect' key binding to alt-N.
         (alt-C was interfering with Copy/Paste)
       * Greatly reduced the flicker in the download status bars.
       * Fixed a race condition in MUSCLE that was causing
         BeShare to crash occasionally during uploads.

v1.30b - Tweaked the download meter text a bit.
       - Added SplitPane controllers to the GUI so you 
         can rearrange the layout to your liking.  (Thanks 
         to YNOP Talton for his excellent SplitPane class!)
       - Added automatic download resume.  Now if you
         attempt to download a file that you already
         have the first piece of, the download will append
         to your current file instead of starting anew.
         Note that both the sending AND receiving clients 
         must be v1.30 or later for auto-resuming to happen!
       - Added a "Reset Layout" option to the File menu.
         This will reset the split pane bars to their
         default orientations... good for when you get lost in the UI...

v1.20b - Added Settings menu with some more options.
       - Added better firewall handling.  Now you can share files
         from behind a firewall, as long as the person you are
         sharing them with isn't also behind a firewall.  (people
         who are behind firewalls won't see the files of other
         people who are also behind a firewall)
       - You can now specify the maximum number of simultaneous
         downloads allowable.  If more sessions than that occur,
         the latter sessions will not begin downloading until 
         the previous ones finish.
       - You can now advertise your upload bandwidth, and see
         the upload bandwidths of other users.
       - Added support for IRC-style /msg and /me commands.
       - Added "Clear Log" menu item.
       - User list is now sortable.
       * PPC version no longer included precompiled... if you
         want to run PPC you'll have to compile it yourself.
       * Fixed a bug where your server setting would be lost
         if you quit without first connecting to the server.
       * The Chat text view now reflows text and in general
         behaves itself better.

v1.11b - Tweaked the UI code so that updating the result list is
         more efficient.  This should be noticable when you are
         listing a large number of files at once.
       - Added a log message that tells how many files you are sharing. 

v1.10b - Changed the peer-to-peer protocol around so that
         people behind firewalls can at least download files.
         First public release.

v1.00b - Beta for Martin


Known problems with BeShare
===========================

- Sometimes you may get errors about "Couldn't create thread" when 
  connecting to the server.  This comes from a problem in BeOS's 
  net_server;  to solve it, restart networking, then restart 
  BeShare, and try again.

- BeShare is not able to transfer files if both machines are behind
  firewalls.  There isn't much that can be done about this.

- When doing a query-by-username (e.g. *@Jeremy), the username
  portion of the query is not "live".  That is to say, the name
  portion of the query is translated into a list of session IDs
  on your client at the time you start the query, and the query
  will only match files owned by one of those session IDs.  So
  if you do a "*@J*" query, and Jeremy logs in after you started
  the query, his files won't show up in your result set (unless
  you do a Stop Query followed by a Start Query).  Lame, I know...
