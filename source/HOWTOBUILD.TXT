In order to recompile BeShare, do the following:

1. Make sure you have the BeOS developers tools 
   (gcc or mwcc) installed on your machine.
2. Download MUSCLE 3.20 or higher from 
      http://www.lcscanada.com/muscle/index.html,
   and unpack it so that the "muscle" directory is present in the
   directory above this one.
3. While in this directory, run "make".  After a minute or two, a fresh 
   BeShare executable named either BeShare.x86 or BeShare.ppc should be ready.
