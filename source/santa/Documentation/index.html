For overpriced shareware (hehehe) orcommercial products, please contact me to negotiate a commercial uselicense. After all, I did work hard on these classes and invested alot of time into it. That being said, DON'T WORRY I don't want much.It totally depends on the sort of project you're working on and howmuch you expect to make off it. If someone makes money using my work,I'd like to get at least a little something for my contribution tothat profit.</P><P>If any of the components of Santa's Gift Bag are is used in ashareware or commercial product, I get a free copy. The source ismade available so that you can improve and extend it as you need. Ingeneral it is best to customize these classes through inheritance,leaving the original Santa's Gift Bag source code unmodified, so thatyou can take advantage of enhancements and bug fixes as they becomeavailable.</P><P>Feel free to distribute any components of this archive, but youare required to keep the documentation and license with it. If youwish to distribute modified versions, also feel free to do so, but doso in such a manner that it is very clear what was modified, why,how, that it is not an official Santa's Gift Bag release, and you arealso required to keep the documentation and license with any modifiedversions.</P><P><HR></P><H2><A NAME="Components"></A>Components</H2><H4><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=1 WIDTH="100%">   <TR>      <TD>         <P><A HREF="ArrowButton.html">ArrowButton</A>      </TD><TD>         <P><A HREF="GenericTestApp.html">GenericTestApp</A>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD>         <P><A HREF="AutoDeleter.html">AutoDeleter</A>      </TD><TD>         <P><A HREF="ImageAboutWindow.html">ImageAboutWindow</A>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD>         <P><A HREF="BetterScrollView.html">BetterScrollView</A>      </TD><TD>         <P><A HREF="MultiLineTextControl.html">MultiLineTextControl</A>            </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD>         <P><A HREF="BufferedFile.html">BufferedFile</A>      </TD><TD>         <P><A HREF="NewStrings.html">NewStrings</A>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD>         <P><A HREF="ChecksumDataBuffer.html">ChecksumDataBuffer</A>      </TD><TD>         <P><A HREF="PrefilledBitmap.html">PrefilledBitmap</A>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD>         <P><A HREF="Colors.html">Colors</A>      </TD><TD>         <P><A HREF="ScrollViewCorner.html">ScrollViewCorner</A>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD>         <P><A HREF="ColumnListView/index.html">ColumnListView</A>      </TD><TD>         <P><A HREF="TabView.html">TabView</A>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD>         <P><A HREF="Cursors.html">Cursors</A>      </TD><TD>         <P><A HREF="TextEntryAlert.html">TextEntryAlert</A>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD>         <P><A HREF="DeepBevelView.html">DeepBevelView</A>      </TD><TD>         <P><A HREF="TypedBList.html">TypedBList</A>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD>         <P><A HREF="DocumentApp/DocumentApp.html">DocumentApp</A>      </TD><TD>         <P><A HREF="UserResizeSplitView.html">UserResizeSplitView</A>            </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD>         <P><A HREF="EndianIndependentFile.html">EndianIndependentFile</A>            </TD><TD>         <P><A HREF="WindowPositionSet.html">WindowPositionSet</A>      </TD></TR>   <TR>      <TD>         <P><A HREF="FontSensitiveLayoutTools/index.html">FontSensitiveLayoutTools</A>            </TD><TD>         <P><A HREF="WrappingTextView.html">WrappingTextView</A>      </TD></TR></TABLE></H4><P><HR></P><H2><A NAME="Overview"></A>Overview</H2><H4><A HREF="ArrowButton.html">ArrowButton</A>:</H4><P>Works just like BButton, but it provides arrows with the standardBe appearance like what is provided with BScrollBar. Theimplementation needs some work, since it was written beforeB_ASYNCHRONOUS_CONTROLS.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4><A HREF="AutoDeleter.html">AutoDeleter</A>:</H4><P>If you new temporary objects in a function with several points ofexit, at each of which the temporary objects need to be deleted, itclutters your code. If you instead create an AutoDeleter on thestack, your dynamically allocated temporary objects will be deletedwith cleaner code. Also, if you use exceptions, as the stack isunwound until the exception is caught, only stack variables will bedeleted, not dynamically allocated ones. If you create an AutoDeleterfor dynamically allocated objects, they will be deleted wherenecessary as the stack is unwound.</P><H4>&nbsp;</H4><H4><A HREF="BetterScrollView.html">BetterScrollView</A>:</H4><P>BScrollView replacement that allows you to specify directly thesize of your data rect, and the BetterScrollView takes care of thescrollbar proportions and inactivating the scroll bars when theentire content is showing, and provides nice "pulling behavior" toreveal the content when the user is resizing the scroll view bigger.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4><A HREF="BufferedFile.html">BufferedFile</A>:</H4><P>Buffers file output for increased efficiency.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4><A HREF="ChecksumDataBuffer.html">ChecksumDataBuffer</A>:</H4><P>Buffers data in an endian-independent manner for networktransmission, and can generate a checksum for transmission bymultiple methods.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4><A HREF="Colors.html">Colors</A>:</H4><P>Provides definitions for commonly used Be user interface colors.Note that you should try to avoid using these when possible, andinstead use ui_color and ui_tint. Also provides definitions for manycommon colors which can't (or wouldn't make sense to) be obtainedfrom ui_color.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4><A HREF="ColumnListView/index.html">ColumnListView</A>:</H4><P>BListView-derived class with columns that the user can resize,drag, sort, etc., with BOutlineListView-like support for hierarchicallists.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4><A HREF="Cursors.html">Cursors</A>:</H4><P>A couple of commonly needed custom cursors.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4><A HREF="DeepBevelView.html">DeepBevelView</A>:</H4><P>A BView that draws a deep bevel like that of BTextControl aroundits perimeter.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4><A HREF="DocumentApp/index.html">DocumentApp</A>:</H4><P>A document file management framework. Provides aBApplication-derived class and a BWindow-derived class which worktogether to give nice document behavior, automating the process ofquitting when the last window closes, prompting to save unsaveddocuments, etc. etc. It saves a LOT of work because getting perfectbehavior in a multi-document application can take hours of coding,testing, and recoding to get it right.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4><A HREF="EndianIndependentFile.html">EndianIndependentFile</A>:</H4><P>BufferedFile-derived class to buffer file output for improvedefficiency and allows readable code style to still be efficient.Eliminates endian-ness issue by providing automatic byte swapping.Includes a handy ReadString/WriteString pair.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4><A HREF="FontSensitiveLayoutTools/index.html">FontSensitiveLayoutTools</A>:</H4><P>A set of classes to facilitate easy font-sensitive GUI layout.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4><A HREF="GenericTestApp.html">GenericTestApp</A>:</H4><P>Generic test application framework for testing code fragments thatneed a GUI. Useful for putting together new Classes and alsosimplest-case code for reporting BeBugs(tm).</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4><A HREF="ImageAboutWindow.html">ImageAboutWindow</A>:</H4><P>A nice looking about box window that extracts an image file from aspecified resource in the application, putting it in a bar on theleft hand side, displaying version info from the application versionresource, and displaying the specified text.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4><A HREF="MultiLineTextControl.html">MultiLineTextControl</A>:</H4><P>Works just like a BTextControl, but allows multiple lines of text.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4><A HREF="NewStrings.html">NewStrings</A>:</H4><P>Wrapper for BFont::GetStringWidths that returns the width of thewidest string. strdup, strcat cousins that do their allocation usingnew.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4><A HREF="PrefilledBitmap.html">PrefilledBitmap</A>:</H4><P>BBitmap wrapper that allows you to specify the image data in theconstructor.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4><A HREF="ScrollViewCorner.html">ScrollViewCorner</A>:</H4><P>A BView for filling the corner of a BScrollView that's not seatedin the lower-right corner of a B_DOCUMENT_WINDOW.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4><A HREF="TabView.html">TabView</A>:</H4><P>The BTabView implementation is really bad for resizable windowsand chokes on hidden child views, TabView handles both casesproperly.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4><A HREF="TextEntryAlert.html">TextEntryAlert</A>:</H4><P>A class very similar to BAlert, but which has a text entry box forthe user to enter text into, which is reported back to theapplication when the user dismisses the dialog. It allows controlover the BWindow look and feel flags, so it need not be a modaldialog, although that is the normal usage.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4><A HREF="TypedBList.html">TypedBList</A>:</H4><P>A templated BList that adds type checking, since BList's use ofvoid* doesn't allow the compiler to do type checking.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4><A HREF="UserResizeSplitView.html">UserResizeSplitView</A>:</H4><P>Provides a user draggable slider to adjust the size of twoadjacent views.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4><A HREF="WindowPositionSet.html">WindowPositionSet</A>:</H4><P>A class to make sure that windows are actually visible onscreenwhen they're created, and to manage the locations of newly createdwindows to space new windows so that each new window doesn't sit ontop of the last one. Gives nice behavior and is easy to use.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><H4><A HREF="WrappingTextView.html">WrappingTextView</A>:</H4><P>A BTextView derived class that automates the process of rewrappingthe text when the view is resized. Also provides a mechanism forstoring the text view contents when appropriate, which is useful ifthe view is of an object that can exist without the view, so thatthis more persistent object can be kept up-to-date when the text ismodified.</P><P><HR></P><H2><A NAME="Revision history"></A>Revision history</H2><P>3.0: Started keeping a revision history for Santa's Gift Bag as awhole. Added documentation for all Santa's Gift Bag components.Removed MouseWatcher, since B_ASYNCHRONOUS_CONTROLS fills this needas of R4. Added FontSensitiveLayoutTools. Added UserResizeSplitView.Fixed a bug in MultiLineTextControl (wasn't changing the TextRect inresponse to resizing). Fixed BufferedPreview in BufferedFile. Fixedbehavior of WindowPositionSet.</P><P><HR></P><P>By Brian Tietz</P><P>Copyright 1997-2000</P><P>Bug reports (including documentation errors) and feature requestscan be sent to<A HREF="mailto:briant@timelinevista.com">briant@timelinevista.com</A>.</P><P>&nbsp;</P></BODY></HTML>
