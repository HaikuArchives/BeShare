TODO / feature list

What I'm working on.
 - When quiting befor disconnect an crach happends.
 - File download error. It now work as mutch that you can download from a 2.28 but not from another 2.30

 - Check username when connect..
 - Use one button for search and de search. they should co exist. When search are finniched..

Bugs
 - Have you fixed the "bug" in BeShare when it itself disconnects and reconnects and doesn't update the session id on 
   failed transfers. If the other party is Unizone the transfer fails, because the session id doesn't match any of the current
   session ids on the server, despite the fact that the user is on the right server.
 - Files go away when user disconnects, even if query isn't active?
 - Upload animations stop sometimes (uploads continue though)? --Garjala
 - drag-and-drop file result to another volume, then quit and restart BeShare - file is saved to root folder instead???
 - Can't "/ping User Name" where User Name has spaces in it... fix that
 - Fix the "users list doesn't scroll down to the last few users sometimes" bug... scroll to top, 
    change column width, then scroll down
 - toggling "I'm Firewalled" doesn't updated the files column?
 - Make sure private chat windows can't get left off-screen
 - fix bug:  remove symlink dir, then create nodes = leaked server nodes?
 - fix bug: symlinks to Windows partitions?

What is this?
 - Rename download-in-progress-files as part_of_{filename} ?
 - Allow BeShare window to be resized smaller
 - Fix ghost-uploads bug
 - fix the type-one-char-while-auto-away bug
 - Fix http://www.blah.com\thttp://www.blah.com not linking

New features
 - Use Haiku Language files.
 - /status <username prints the users status
 - Add an optional argument to /unban so that Garjala can /unban just a single IP rather than all of them.
 - list the current /bans (IP address and duration?)
 - Dragging a file from the results pane to the transfer pane should start a dowlnoad of that file.
 - Drag a user from the users list into a private chat window to add him to the chat 
 - Right-click on username in chat log opens popup menu for that user? (same as clicking on the user in the users list)
 - Add checkboxes to selected item in name/server/status popup menus
 - max-per-user and limit-upload-rate should be per IP, not per session ID
 - Check "File Copy 2", etc, for possible resume, instead of always created a new file with the generated file name
 - Give a special icon to incomplete download files
 - figure out logging when /priv * and /priv 908 are both present??
 - delete from d/l list using delete, delete from disk using shift-delete
 - /quit gotta go eat  <-- message in your /quit command
 - Tell user where he is in line while queued
 - include user and file count in /serverinfo
 - Warn if username clashes with another session?
 - handle multiple like-named files by munging file name?
 - Make tab completion work even when you aren't at EOL
 - Preserve sorting preferences for user table/attributes
 - retain selection on list-modification or sort
 - down arrow goes back to text you were typing

Gregor's suggested TODOs
 - define custom shortcuts that are expanded/TAB-able in the textview (like Jabber's "quips")  (jaf -- /alias does this, kinda?)
 - expand commands  (jaf--what does this mean exactly?)
 - report proper usage of commands when used wrongly (currently a wrong error-message "command xx unknown" is shown)

Eventually
 - /url http://www.lcscanada.com/jaf -- UserName in list and chat is linked
 - Right-click column header brings up attribute popup-menu, similar to in a Tracker window
 - Drag a column out of the window to remove that column
 - Make name change update downloads/uploads boxes
 - Stop that annoying shrink-window - no-scroll-mode behaviour
 - Allow user to choose download and shared directories.
 - Make down arrow on scroll bar flash when new unseen text is added
 - Show column for dir file is in

Maybe
 - Make private chat windows always-on-top of BeShare window?
 - Allow selection of which app to launch a file with (a la tracker) (Open With)
 - Deskbar icon, flashes when your name is mentioned (or whatnot)
 - "Show myself" option (REFLECT_TO_SELF)
 - Add current uploads/max uploads columns to user list
 - custom icon for user?
 - Show upload/download file list by right-clicking on transfer box
 - server<-server federation?
 - make it a replicant 
 - allow full BFS style attribute-based searches

 Hey there, Technix,  here are my UI suggestions about BeShare.  I 
 LOVE BeShare but the UI gives me shivers (bad ones).  Heh heh.
 
 Big things:
 
1.  Overloaded menus: Take everything on the settings menu and make  it all into a proper Preferences window, 
	accessed via a File menu 
 item called "Settings..." or "Preferences..."    I would suggest 
 modeling the design of the Preferences window off of what 
 OpenTracker uses for its settings window.  Then remove the Settings 
 menu entirely.  Also, move "File - Clear Chat Log" and "File - 
 Reset Layout" to the Preferences/Settings interface.
 
2.  All context menus should be sticky (right-click on a person's 
 name in the user list or on a download and the context menu should 
 stay open without holding the button. Just like Tracker, Desktop, 
 many apps... etc).
 3.  A way to edit the lists for Server, Status, User Name and 
 Query, in case we want to keep certain items or eliminate typos.
 
 Little (but nice to have) things:
 
 1.  Proper resize corner on the window's resize corner (the grip 
 corner I mean).
 2.  When the cursor does mouse_over where the "view resize" divider 
 is, the cursor ought reflect that state, so that users don't have 
 to accidentally find it like I did when I said "maybe I can click 
 and drag these views... oh, yeah I can, how about that."
 3.  Add Double-click on column dividers to auto-size to the length 
 of the longest item (see the list view in Tracker).
 4.  BeShare seems to suffer from the "cursor shape forgetting" 
 problem of some older apps.  Supposedly something changed in the 
 API that allowed this to work better.  Postmaster has the same 
 problem.  Example: cursor changes to the column size cursor and 
 stays that way once you're done sizing.  Not all the time, but 
 sometimes.  A bug in the mouse_over code I guess...
 5.  Some way to resize the text fields for name and status.  Maybe 
 simply size proportionally with the window size change.
 6.  Kill the redraw flicker when changing sizes of the views ;)  (a 
 minor issue, yes)
 7.  Allow me to delete items from my drive via the download list's 
 context menu, instead of having to go to the download folder - this 
 also should remove that item from the list, too.
 8.  Change "Open Folder" to "Show in Tracker" on the context menu 
 for the files downloaded.
 9.  Use node monitoring(?) like Net+ does: when a file is deleted 
 from the download folder (or moved out of it) the download ought to 
 dissappear from the downloads list - user should only have to do 
 ONE thing to eliminate a download, not two.
 10.  Why is the "move to top" and other "move" items in the 
 download context menu?  Wouldn't it be easier to just use drag and 
 drop and a highlighted line showing the user where it would go on 
 drop?  I've never wanted to arrange items in here, personally, 
 either...
 11.  Proper highlight for selected items in the download list.  
 These are not buttons, afterall.  Instead of "pushing in" as they 
 do when they are selected, can they not simply highlight in a 
 slight light-yellow or light-blue or something?  Like the download 
 window in Net+.  In fact, making the download UI match the Net+ 
 download UI would be really cool.  The Net+ download manager is the 
 best download manager I've seen on any OS with any browser.  Too 
 bad we can't just drop it into BeShare :)  Net+ as open source 
 would have been a great addition to the open components of BeOS ;)
 12.  Can't the Query results show up in a status bar instead of the 
 title bar?
 13.  Would be cool if you could right-click on a person's name or 
 ID in the chat text and select "insert" to plunk it down into your 
 Chat text wherever the cursor is.
 14. Naming of Attribute listing presets.
